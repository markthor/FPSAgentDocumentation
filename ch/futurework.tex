\section{Future work}
The integration of the CNN and the ANN evolved with neuroevolution involved binarising the output of the CNN, such that the CNN mimics the output that the evolved ANN was trained with. However, this does not explore the potential of the evolved ANN to use the analog output of the CNN, which might make the integration work better. The probability distribution of the features vector of the visual partitioning representation reveals additional information about the position of the target, as an uncertainty usually means that the target is between two partitions. Consequently, we believe that evolving the ANN with the analog output of the CNN could result in even better performance than using the ground truths directly.
