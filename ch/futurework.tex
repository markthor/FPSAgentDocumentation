\section{Future work}

The integration of the VRC and AIC involved binarising the output of the VRC, such that it mimics the output that the AIC was trained with. However, this does not explore the potential of the AIC to use the analog output of the CNN, which might make the integration work better. The probability distribution of the features vector of the visual partitioning representation reveals additional information about the position of the target, as an uncertainty usually means that the target is between two partitions, as exemplified in figure \ref{fig:uncertain}. Consequently, we believe that evolving the ANN with the analog output of the CNN could result in even better performance than using the ground truths directly.
