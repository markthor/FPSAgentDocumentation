We would like to thank our supervisor Sebastian Risi\footnote{\url{http://sebastianrisi.com/}} for guidance throughout the project.

A special thanks has to be given to Muhsin Kaymak for his priceless help with getting the Unity framework to suit our needs.

The Deep Learning for Java\footnote{\url{https://deeplearning4j.org/}} community has given paramount assistance with the deep learning framework - especially raver119\footnote{\url{https://github.com/raver119}}, AlexDBlack\footnote{\url{https://github.com/AlexDBlack}} and agibsonccc\footnote{\url{https://github.com/agibsonccc}}.
