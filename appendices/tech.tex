\subsection{Bridging between Unity and DL4J}\todo{Move this to Theory?}
The game used is made using the game engine Unity, where it is possible to interface with the game using either C\#, JavaScript, Boo or Unity Script.

The convolutional neural network is trained using DL4J \todo{Has DL4J been introduced at this point?}, which is written in Java.
It is unfortunately not possible to interface with the game using Java. Somehow the game has to communicate with a convolutional neural network.
